# mafia_asm

This is my approach to learn some 6502 assembly and to convert/improve an obscure basic game at the same time. You have been warned ;)
You might find code-snippets from forum64.de, retro-programming.de, 64bites.com, codebase64.org and even some lines I might have written myself.

This whole project compiles with KickAssembler >= 4.x

gameMain.asm is the base for building, as it imports everything else.
